/// Connection configuration.
///
/// Configuration can be parsed from libpq-style connection strings. These strings come in two formats:
///
/// # Key-Value
///
/// This format consists of space-separated key-value pairs. Values which are either the empty string or contain
/// whitespace should be wrapped in `'`. `'` and `\` characters should be backslash-escaped.
///
/// ## Keys
///
/// * `user` - The username to authenticate with. Required.
/// * `password` - The password to authenticate with.
/// * `dbname` - The name of the database to connect to. Defaults to the username.
/// * `options` - Command line options used to configure the server.
/// * `application_name` - Sets the `application_name` parameter on the server.
/// * `sslmode` - Controls usage of TLS. If set to `disable`, TLS will not be used. If set to `prefer`, TLS will be used
///     if available, but not used otherwise. If set to `require`, TLS will be forced to be used. Defaults to `prefer`.
/// * `host` - The host to connect to. On Unix platforms, if the host starts with a `/` character it is treated as the
///     path to the directory containing Unix domain sockets. Otherwise, it is treated as a hostname. Multiple hosts
///     can be specified, separated by commas. Each host will be tried in turn when connecting. Required if connecting
///     with the `connect` method.
/// * `hostaddr` - Numeric IP address of host to connect to. This should be in the standard IPv4 address format,
///     e.g., 172.28.40.9. If your machine supports IPv6, you can also use those addresses.
///     If this parameter is not specified, the value of `host` will be looked up to find the corresponding IP address,
///     or if host specifies an IP address, that value will be used directly.
///     Using `hostaddr` allows the application to avoid a host name look-up, which might be important in applications
///     with time constraints. However, a host name is required for TLS certificate verification.
///     Specifically:
///         * If `hostaddr` is specified without `host`, the value for `hostaddr` gives the server network address.
///             The connection attempt will fail if the authentication method requires a host name;
///         * If `host` is specified without `hostaddr`, a host name lookup occurs;
///         * If both `host` and `hostaddr` are specified, the value for `hostaddr` gives the server network address.
///             The value for `host` is ignored unless the authentication method requires it,
///             in which case it will be used as the host name.
/// * `port` - The port to connect to. Multiple ports can be specified, separated by commas. The number of ports must be
///     either 1, in which case it will be used for all hosts, or the same as the number of hosts. Defaults to 5432 if
///     omitted or the empty string.
/// * `connect_timeout` - The time limit in seconds applied to each socket-level connection attempt. Note that hostnames
///     can resolve to multiple IP addresses, and this limit is applied to each address. Defaults to no timeout.
/// * `tcp_user_timeout` - The time limit that transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before a connection is forcibly closed.
///     This is ignored for Unix domain socket connections. It is only supported on systems where TCP_USER_TIMEOUT is available
///     and will default to the system default if omitted or set to 0; on other systems, it has no effect.
/// * `keepalives` - Controls the use of TCP keepalive. A value of 0 disables keepalive and nonzero integers enable it.
///     This option is ignored when connecting with Unix sockets. Defaults to on.
/// * `keepalives_idle` - The number of seconds of inactivity after which a keepalive message is sent to the server.
///     This option is ignored when connecting with Unix sockets. Defaults to 2 hours.
/// * `keepalives_interval` - The time interval between TCP keepalive probes.
///     This option is ignored when connecting with Unix sockets.
/// * `keepalives_retries` - The maximum number of TCP keepalive probes that will be sent before dropping a connection.
///     This option is ignored when connecting with Unix sockets.
/// * `target_session_attrs` - Specifies requirements of the session. If set to `read-write`, the client will check that
///     the `transaction_read_write` session parameter is set to `on`. This can be used to connect to the primary server
///     in a database cluster as opposed to the secondary read-only mirrors. Defaults to `all`.
/// * `channel_binding` - Controls usage of channel binding in the authentication process. If set to `disable`, channel
///     binding will not be used. If set to `prefer`, channel binding will be used if available, but not used otherwise.
///     If set to `require`, the authentication process will fail if channel binding is not used. Defaults to `prefer`.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```not_rust
/// host=localhost user=postgres connect_timeout=10 keepalives=0
/// ```
///
/// ```not_rust
/// host=/var/lib/postgresql,localhost port=1234 user=postgres password='password with spaces'
/// ```
///
/// ```not_rust
/// host=host1,host2,host3 port=1234,,5678 hostaddr=127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3 user=postgres target_session_attrs=read-write
/// ```
///
/// ```not_rust
/// host=host1,host2,host3 port=1234,,5678 user=postgres target_session_attrs=read-write
/// ```
///
/// # Url
///
/// This format resembles a URL with a scheme of either `postgres://` or `postgresql://`. All components are optional,
/// and the format accepts query parameters for all of the key-value pairs described in the section above. Multiple
/// host/port pairs can be comma-separated. Unix socket paths in the host section of the URL should be percent-encoded,
/// as the path component of the URL specifies the database name.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```not_rust
/// postgresql://user@localhost
/// ```
///
/// ```not_rust
/// postgresql://user:password@%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fpostgresql/mydb?connect_timeout=10
/// ```
///

/// postgresql://user@host1:1234,host2,host3:5678?target_session_attrs=read-write
