//! An asynchronous, pipelined, PostgreSQL client.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokio_postgres::{NoTls, Error};
//!
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "runtime"))] fn main() {}
//! # #[cfg(feature = "runtime")]
//! #[tokio::main] // By default, tokio_postgres uses the tokio crate as its runtime.
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     // Connect to the database.
//!     let (client, connection) =
//!         tokio_postgres::connect("host=localhost user=postgres", NoTls).await?;
//!
//!     // The connection object performs the actual communication with the database,
//!     // so spawn it off to run on its own.
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         if let Err(e) = connection.await {
//!             eprintln!("connection error: {}", e);
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     // Now we can execute a simple statement that just returns its parameter.
//!     let rows = client
//!         .query("SELECT $1::TEXT", &[&"hello world"])
//!         .await?;
//!
//!     // And then check that we got back the same string we sent over.
//!     let value: &str = rows[0].get(0);
//!     assert_eq!(value, "hello world");
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Behavior
//!
//! Calling a method like `Client::query` on its own does nothing. The associated request is not sent to the database
//! until the future returned by the method is first polled. Requests are executed in the order that they are first
//! polled, not in the order that their futures are created.
//!
//! # Pipelining
//!
//! The client supports *pipelined* requests. Pipelining can improve performance in use cases in which multiple,
//! independent queries need to be executed. In a traditional workflow, each query is sent to the server after the
//! previous query completes. In contrast, pipelining allows the client to send all of the queries to the server up
//! front, minimizing time spent by one side waiting for the other to finish sending data:
//!
//! ```not_rust
//!             Sequential                              Pipelined
//! | Client         | Server          |    | Client         | Server          |
//! |----------------|-----------------|    |----------------|-----------------|
//! | send query 1   |                 |    | send query 1   |                 |
//! |                | process query 1 |    | send query 2   | process query 1 |
//! | receive rows 1 |                 |    | send query 3   | process query 2 |
//! | send query 2   |                 |    | receive rows 1 | process query 3 |
//! |                | process query 2 |    | receive rows 2 |                 |
//! | receive rows 2 |                 |    | receive rows 3 |                 |
//! | send query 3   |                 |
//! |                | process query 3 |
//! | receive rows 3 |                 |
//! ```
//!
//! In both cases, the PostgreSQL server is executing the queries sequentially - pipelining just allows both sides of
//! the connection to work concurrently when possible.
//!
//! Pipelining happens automatically when futures are polled concurrently (for example, by using the futures `join`
//! combinator):
//!
//! ```rust
//! use futures_util::future;
//! use std::future::Future;
//! use tokio_postgres::{Client, Error, Statement};
//!
//! async fn pipelined_prepare(
//!     client: &Client,
//! ) -> Result<(Statement, Statement), Error>
//! {
//!     future::try_join(
//!         client.prepare("SELECT * FROM foo"),
//!         client.prepare("INSERT INTO bar (id, name) VALUES ($1, $2)")
//!     ).await
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Runtime
//!
//! The client works with arbitrary `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` streams. Convenience APIs are provided to handle the
//! connection process, but these are gated by the `runtime` Cargo feature, which is enabled by default. If disabled,
//! all dependence on the tokio runtime is removed.
//!
//! # SSL/TLS support
//!
//! TLS support is implemented via external libraries. `Client::connect` and `Config::connect` take a TLS implementation
//! as an argument. The `NoTls` type in this crate can be used when TLS is not required. Otherwise, the
//! `postgres-openssl` and `postgres-native-tls` crates provide implementations backed by the `openssl` and `native-tls`
//! crates, respectively.
//!
